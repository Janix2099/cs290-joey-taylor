        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We're passionate Marvel Snap players ourselves, and we noticed the lack of a simple tool for players to share and track their deck collections. Our mission is to provide an easy-to-use platform for the Marvel Snap community to manage/share their card collections with the community.</p>
