        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We're passionate Marvel Snap players ourselves, and we noticed the lack of a simple tool for players to share and track their deck collections. Our mission is to provide an easy-to-use platform for Marvel Snap enthusiasts to manage their card collections, build decks, and share their setups with the community.</p>
