Assignment 5

Going to make a basic implementation of server-side scripting for the sake of this assignment, 
but how I plan to implement it into the Marvel Snap Website is to use a server to create URLs and some Lazy Loading with the card display.
All card data will also be on the server, includding tags.

For the implementation site, I made a simple server to host some funny star wars quotes utilizing fastapi
# type python -m uvicorn star_wars_app:app --reload to host!

The tutorial site is where I spent most of my effort, and frankly could have just used it for the first site as well.
My web development friend said explaining Logging should be fairly quick, so that is what I made my tutorial on.
Ended up learning about StringIO and had a weird error with the logs creating their own htmls, so that had to make some work arounds.
# type python -m uvicorn example_logging:app --reload to host!
