Assignment 5

Going to make a basic implementation of server-side scripting for the sake of this assignment, 
but how I plan to implement it into the Marvel Snap Website is to use a server to create URLs and some Lazy Loading with the card display.
All card data will also be on the server, includding tags.

For the implementation site, I made a simple server to host some funny star wars quotes.
# type python -m uvicorn star_wars_app:app --reload to host!
