5 Websites I like / dislike: 

1. Moodle https://moodle.linnbenton.edu
I dislike Moodle because of various inconveniences, but one of the more tedious ones is simply due to how frequently it signs you out. Assuming this is a safety procaution, would it not be wiser to have a sort of toggle you select on log in for how long you want it to be before you must sign back in again?

2. Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_ydiHsjA_8
Everything is clean and super accessible for the average viewer. My only real critique is that I do not like how the dislike count is hidden. Why even have a dislike button in the first place in that case?

3. Backpack.tf https://backpack.tf
Inconvenient to search for weapons of various types (can't just type 'unusual [insert hat here] into the search bar and instead have to use various drop down menus and pages).

4. Dominos https://www.dominos.com/en/
Perhaps more of a critique on the business model, but having to sort through their various coupons makes it so there might as well not even be a standard menu option since there is no way they expect us not to utilize them. (25 dollars for a large pizza vs 25 for 4 medium pizzas with coupons). Make the menus more conjoined.

5. Amazon https://www.amazon.com
Really annoying to look at, practically useless when not utilizing the search menu. Hate the clutter and millions of cards on 'trendy deals' like cups and pans.
