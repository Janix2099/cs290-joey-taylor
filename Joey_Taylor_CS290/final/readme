Final

Finish the Marvel Snap Collection Tracker Site, make it so you can select an array of cards that work with filters.
When you click on the finalize collection button, it will take you to your collection which will have a unique URL so that 
it is sharable. Make the card information server sided.

I demonstrated all the necessary components in the construction of the website. 
Though I did not make the full card database since I did not want to input 300 cards, and instead just did enough to show off functionality.

Reviewing the Sites from Start of Term Critiques:
1. Moodle: Still no sympathy for Moodle
2. Youtube: Not having a dislike button is still dumb, and I am still super impressed by its design.
3. Backpack.tf: I imagine they would need to refactor a lot of their code in order to make it so you can search for the item in question 
along with their attributes by simply typing. Though I think it is also likely the hack could be fairly simple too.
4. Dominos: Yeah it was mainly just a business model complaint. Though I do think the structure of their site could be a bit more appealing.
5. Amazon: I have a bit more sympathy with having to literally display everything possible within a single website.
At least the search bar is convenient.

My previous projects were just about setting up the baselines of this website, which I transitioned into this final. 
For assignments 4 and 5 I made their own websites so that I could get the assignments done.. so I don't feel any ill will towards how barebones they are.

Server.py says how to run the server in case that isn't obvious to you somehow, I am probably just being paranoid.

I hope you have a wonderful break!
